# RoomBooking

This is a group project that was designed and developed with 5 other students. We created a room booking application for the Broadcasting/Radio/Television department 
at our College using C# (.net Framework MVC), Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

The website allows users to create/manage accounts, create/manage bookings, set permissions for accounts and rooms, etc.

Highlighted features: email notifications, bulk user creation/delete, bulk booking deletion, fully interative calendar view, dashboard view, custom error messages, 
responsive design for both desktop and mobile screens.
