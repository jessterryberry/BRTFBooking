# RoomBooking

This was originally a group project that was designed and developed with 5 other students. We created a room booking application for the Broadcasting/Radio/Television department at our College using C# (.NET Core MVC), Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
After graduating, I finalized the app to a launch-ready state to replace the previous system in the upcoming terms.

The website allows students to book rooms on the campus for project work, see available time slots, and manage their existing bookings.
Teachers are able to create/manage user accounts, set permissions for accounts and rooms, and easily review bookings requiring approval.

Highlighted features: email notifications, bulk user creation (from Excel/CSV)/delete, bulk booking deletion, fully interactive calendar view, dashboard view, custom error messages, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile screens.
